## 10/26/2025 7:08 PM - Research  

I research the different mcu controllers and decided on the rp 2354a due to onboard flash + hravily document. This made research, with the rp235x design datasheet, easy.

## 10/26/2025 7:13 PM - Made Schematic  

I made a schematic referencing the rp235x design datasheet and the pico fido project on blueprint. The schematic has of note: 
- an indicator LED
- an usb-c male port/component.

## 10/26/2025 7:38 PM - Routed PCB  

I routed the pcb with minimal amounts of vias to allow images to be placed effectively. I used the 402 footprint for capacitors and the 603 footprint for resistors.
