## 10/26/2025 7:08 PM - Research  

I research the different mcu controllers and decided on the rp 2354a due to onboard flash + hravily document. This made research, with the rp235x design datasheet, easy.

## 10/26/2025 7:13 PM - Made Schematic  

I made a schematic referencing the rp235x design datasheet and the pico fido project on blueprint. The schematic has of note: 
- an indicator LED
- an usb-c male port/component.

## 10/26/2025 7:38 PM - Routed PCB  

I routed the pcb with minimal amounts of vias to allow images to be placed effectively. I used the 402 footprint for capacitors and the 603 footprint for resistors.

## 10/26/2025 7:55 PM - Added stuff to the silk screen  

I created an image using the raspberry pi logo and a lock silhouette. This became an icon which I have labelled " Secured by Raspberry Pi ". This is there for fun, mostly...

## 10/26/2025 8:07 PM - Added Keychain hole  

I added a grounded keychain hole to add an extra feature to it (It's grounded) and also allows easy portability, which is necessary for security keys, because they are less of something you plug in and more of something you carry with you to act as a physical barrier to your accounts.

## 10/26/2025 8:23 PM - Created JLCPCB order  

Created JLCPCB order, but in doing so realised that the usb-c male connector required standard pcba (not gonna do that) so this project will be for tickets.
